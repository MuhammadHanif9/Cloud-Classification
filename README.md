# Cloud Classification using YOLOv8 and Computer Vision
# Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying different types of clouds using YOLOv8 and Computer Vision techniques. The goal is to accurately identify five types of clouds from images, providing a useful tool for meteorological studies and weather forecasting.

# Cloud Types Classified
Cumulus
Stratus
Cirrus
Cumulonimbus
Altostratus
# Features
Accurate detection and classification of cloud types.
Utilizes YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model.
Implemented with Python and essential libraries like OpenCV and NumPy.
Trained on a diverse dataset to ensure robust performance.
# Usage
You can use the trained model to classify clouds in your own images.
